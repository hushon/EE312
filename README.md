# Tiny RISC-V CPU

## Introduction

This repository contains RTL of a simple CPU architecture that implements our miniaturized version of the [RISC-V Instruction Set](https://riscv.org/). This project was designed and written as a result of a lab assignment during the computer architecture course at KAIST.

Our implementation includes a few variants:  

- Single-cycle CPU
- Multi-cycle CPU
- Pipelined CPU
- Multi-cycle CPU with direct-mapped cache
